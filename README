File-OFind

File::OFind is an object oriented replacement for File::Find.
"File::OFind" was designed to be easy to use. Just pass it a list of
directories to search, and it'll act just like the Unix find command.
This module uses an iterator, so that fetching each file can take place
inside your main code and not in a subroutine.

At the same time, this module allows you to set a wide array of
options, and provides a wide array of methods for fetching particular
aspects of a file.

INSTALLATION
